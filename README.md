# React + TypeScript + Vite + Husky Setup

This project is a minimal React app created with Vite, configured with TypeScript and Husky to enforce type checking and linting before commits.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Create React Project with Vite

```bash
npm create vite@latest
Enter your project name

Select the React + TypeScript template

Navigate into your project folder

Install dependencies:


npm install
2. Add TypeScript Type Check Script
Add this script to your package.json under "scripts":


"typecheck": "tsc --build --noEmit"
This runs TypeScript in build mode and checks for type errors without generating output files.

3. Install and Setup Husky
Run the following commands to initialize Husky and install dependencies:


npx husky-init
npm install
4. Configure Husky Pre-commit Hook
Edit the .husky/pre-commit file to include:


#!/usr/bin/env sh
. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"
echo "Running Typecheck and Linting..."
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
echo "âœ… All checks passed!"

This hook ensures that type checking and linting run before every commit. If either fails, the commit will be blocked.

Usage
Run type checking manually:


npm run typecheck
Run linting manually:


npm run lint
Commit your changes as usual; Husky will automatically run the type check and lint scripts before committing.

Notes
Make sure your tsconfig.app.json (or main tsconfig) includes your source files, usually with:


"include": ["src"]
You can customize Husky hooks to add other checks or formatters like Prettier or lint-staged if desired.
